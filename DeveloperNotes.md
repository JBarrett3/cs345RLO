# Developer Notes

Please note that if you are a student in CS345, then this section does not pertain to you and will not be of use to you. This section contains notes on project sourcing and testing.

## Sourcing

We give credit to the source of the original unmodified data: **TODO**. We emphasize that we have made extensive modifications to add cleaning tasks to the dataset, so it is no longer an accurate representation of the source material.

## Testing

We have written test code, but we keep that file in a separate private repository: [https://github.com/JBarrett3/cs345RLOtesting](https://github.com/JBarrett3/cs345RLOtesting). This prevents students from reading through the test file and discovering any of the cleaning tasks unfairly. The process of obfuscaton is described more openly in the private repo, but for all intends and purposes, it is enough for end users to know that the test file cannot be humanly read or recovered without more knowledge contained in the private repo.
