# Developer Notes

Please note that if you are a student in CS345, then this section does not pertain to you and will not be of use to you. This section contains notes on project sourcing and testing.

## Sourcing

We give credit to the source of the original unmodified data: **TODO**. We emphasize that we have made extensive modifications to add cleaning tasks to the dataset, so it is no longer an accurate representation of the source material.

## Testing

We have written a python test code, but we keep the original file in a separate [instructor repository](https://github.com/JBarrett3/cs345RLOtesting). This prevents students from reading through the test file and discovering any of the cleaning tasks in an unfair way. The process of obfuscaton is described more openly in the instructor's repo, but for all intends and purposes, it is enough for end users to know that the test file cannot be humanly read or recovered without more knowledge contained in the instructor's repo.

## Solutions

Along with the test code, we have compiled a list of the issues, exemplar queries to discover each issue, and exemplar queries to correct each issue in the private instructor repository.
